3.9.2. Element KEYOPTS
Each contact element includes several KEYOPTS. Ansys recommends using the default settings, which
are suitable for most contact problems. For some specific applications, you can override the defaults.
The element KEYOPTS allow you to control several aspects of contact behavior.
• Degrees of freedom (KEYOPT(1)) (p. 169)
• Contact algorithm (defaults to augmented Lagrangian) (KEYOPT(2)) (p. 47)
• Unit control for normal contact stiffness or contact element stress state (KEYOPT(3)) (p. 95)
• Location of contact detection point (KEYOPT(4)) (p. 67)
• CNOF Automated adjustment (KEYOPT(5)) (p. 74)

Set the Real Constants and Element KEYOPTS

• Penalty method (KEYOPT(2) = 1)
• Augmented Lagrangian (default) (KEYOPT(2) = 0)
• Lagrange multiplier on contact normal and penalty on tangent (KEYOPT(2) = 3)
• Pure Lagrange multiplier on contact normal and tangent (KEYOPT(2) = 4)
• Internal multipoint constraint (MPC) (KEYOPT(2) = 2)
The penalty method uses a contact spring to establish a relationship between the two contact surfaces.
The spring stiffness is called the contact stiffness. This method uses the following real constants: FKN
and FKT for all values of KEYOPT(10), plus FTOLN and SLTO if KEYOPT(10) = 0 or 2.
The augmented Lagrangian method (which is the default) is an iterative series of penalty methods.
The contact tractions (pressure and frictional stresses) are augmented during equilibrium iterations
so that the final penetration on most contact nodes is smaller than the allowable tolerance (FTOLN).
Compared to the penalty method, the augmented Lagrangian method usually leads to better condi-
tioning and is less sensitive to the magnitude of the contact stiffness. However, in some analyses, the
augmented Lagrangian method may require additional iterations, especially if the deformed mesh
becomes too distorted.
The pure Lagrange multiplier method enforces zero penetration when contact is closed and "zero
slip" when sticking contact occurs. The pure Lagrange multiplier method does not require contact
stiffness, FKN and FKT. Instead it requires chattering control parameters, FTOLN and TNOP. This
method adds contact traction to the model as additional degrees of freedom and requires additional
iterations to stabilize contact conditions. It often increases the computational cost compared to the
augmented Lagrangian method.
An alternative algorithm is the Lagrange multiplier method applied on the contact normal and the
penalty method (tangential contact stiffness) on the frictional plane. This method enforces zero pen-
etration and allows a small amount of slip for the sticking contact condition. It requires chattering
control parameters, FTOLN and TNOP, as well as the maximum allowable elastic slip parameter SLTO.
The internal multipoint constraint (MPC) algorithm is used in conjunction with bonded contact (KEY-
OPT(12) = 5 or 6) and no separation contact (KEYOPT(12) = 4) to model several types of contact as-
semblies and kinematic constraints. See Multipoint Constraints and Assemblies (p. 245) for more in-
formation about how to use this feature.
3.9.3.1. Lagrange Multiplier Method Considerations
Keep the following points in mind when using the Lagrange multiplier methods.
1. The Lagrange multiplier methods (KEYOPT(2) = 3, 4) do not support the Gauss point detection
option (KEYOPT(4) = 0) for surface-to-surface contact. They support the nodal detection options
for surface-to-surface contact and node-to-surface contact. When using these options, be careful
not to overconstrain the model. The model is overconstrained when a contact node has pre-
